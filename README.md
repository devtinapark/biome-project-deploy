# Nibiru Biome Project

## Overview
This project is a Next.js / React app designed to interact with Nibiru CosmWasm smart contracts. The Nibiru Biome Project enables users to purchase Biome tokens, serving as carbon offset credits to support diverse eco-friendly initiatives globally.

## Nibiru Chain Track
Nibiru Chain is a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain and smart contract ecosystem, offering superior throughput and unmatched security. Since its emergence from stealth mode in late 2022, dozens of projects have been built on Nibiru, spanning DeFi, gaming, real-world assets, NFTs, developer tools, and bridgesâ€”each committed to making digital asset interactions fast, secure, and user-friendly.

## Getting Started

## Project Story: Why the Biome Project?

In an era of globalization, the rise in digital nomads and world travelers contributes to an increasing environmental impact through heightened carbon footprints. The Biome Project aims to counteract this effect by providing users with the opportunity to purchase Biome tokens, serving as carbon offset credits, to support eco-projects worldwide. Leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, security, and autonomy, users can acquire Biomes using Unibi coins and designate them to selected projects through our interactive globe feature within the app. Moreover, individuals have the option to submit their own eco-projects for consideration and support.

## Features

- **Interactive Globe**: Explore and support eco-projects across the globe.
- **Biome Tokens**: Purchase carbon offset credits using Unibi coins.
- **Project Application**: Submit eco-projects for listing and support.
- **Blockchain Transparency**: Ensuring secure and autonomous transactions.
